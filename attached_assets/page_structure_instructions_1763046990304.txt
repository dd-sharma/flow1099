I need you to create the landing page structure for Flow1099, a tax compliance SaaS specifically targeting creative agencies. We have a logo at /public/flow1099-logo.png that features flowing gradient shapes in blue/purple tones.

TASKS TO COMPLETE:
1. Install Lucide React: npm install lucide-react
2. Create /app/page.tsx for the homepage
3. Create /app/layout.tsx with HTML structure and metadata
4. Create /components/layout/Header.tsx with navigation
5. Create /components/layout/Footer.tsx with links and copyright
6. Add responsive navigation with mobile hamburger menu

BRAND CONTEXT:
Flow1099 helps creative agencies manage freelancer tax compliance year-round instead of scrambling in January. Our key differentiator is unlimited 1099 filing for $79/month vs competitors' per-form pricing.

TARGET AUDIENCE: Creative agencies (design studios, digital agencies, branding agencies) who work with multiple freelancers per project.

DESIGN REQUIREMENTS:
- Clean, minimal, typography-forward design (think Stripe meets Linear)
- Use the color palette from our logo: blues (#6366F1 to #8B5CF6) and purples with gradients
- Lots of white space, strong grid system
- Subtle animations on scroll and hover
- Mobile-first responsive design
- Professional but approachable, not corporate

HOMEPAGE STRUCTURE (/app/page.tsx):

Hero Section:
- Headline: "Tax compliance that doesn't interrupt your creative flow"
- Subheadline: "Stop losing billable hours to 1099 paperwork. Manage freelancer taxes as beautifully as you manage projects."
- Two CTAs: "Start Free Trial" (primary) and "Watch 2-min Demo" (secondary)
- Below CTAs: "Join 47 agencies on the early access list"
- Background: Subtle gradient mesh or flowing shapes echoing the logo

Problem Validation Section:
- Title: "Built for how creative agencies actually work"
- Three stats cards:
  • "23 average freelancers per agency"
  • "47 hours lost to tax compliance annually"  
  • "$3,200 average IRS penalties per year"
- Source citation: "Data from Creative Agency Operations Report 2024"

Features Section (4 features in 2x2 grid):
1. "Project-Based Tracking" - Track freelancers by client and project, not just totals
2. "Unlimited Filing for $79/month" - One price for your entire creative roster
3. "Automatic W-9 Collection" - Built into your freelancer onboarding flow
4. "Smart Payment Monitoring" - Get alerts before crossing IRS thresholds

Integration Section:
- Title: "Plays perfectly with your creative stack"
- Show logos in a row: Harvest, Toggl, QuickBooks, Stripe, Monday.com
- Subtitle: "Seamless integrations with the tools agencies already use"

How It Works (3 steps):
1. "Connect your payment tools" - Import freelancer data from existing systems
2. "We handle compliance year-round" - Automatic W-9 requests and threshold monitoring  
3. "File with confidence in January" - One-click filing with zero surprises

Pricing Preview:
- Title: "Pricing that makes sense for agencies"
- Comparison: "Your cost with others: $350-500 for 25 freelancers" vs "Your cost with Flow1099: $79 flat rate"
- CTA: "View pricing details"

Early Access CTA:
- Title: "Be among the first agencies to automate tax compliance"
- Email signup form with button "Reserve Early Access"
- Below: "Launching January 2025 • Lock in founder pricing"

HEADER (/components/layout/Header.tsx):
- Logo on left (use the uploaded logo)
- Center nav items: Features, Pricing, Integrations, About
- Right side: "Sign In" link and "Start Free Trial" button
- Mobile: Hamburger menu with slide-out drawer
- On scroll: Add subtle backdrop blur and shadow

FOOTER (/components/layout/Footer.tsx):
- 4 columns:
  • Product: Features, Pricing, Integrations, API Docs
  • Company: About, Blog, Careers (marked "Coming Soon")
  • Legal: Terms, Privacy, Security
  • Connect: Contact, Twitter/X, LinkedIn
- Bottom bar: © 2025 Flow1099 • "Built for creative agencies, by creative agency veterans"

LAYOUT (/app/layout.tsx):
- Include metadata for SEO
- Add Inter font for body text and DM Sans for headings
- Set up the gradient color scheme as CSS variables
- Include smooth scroll behavior

TECHNICAL NOTES:
- Use Tailwind CSS for styling
- Implement intersection observer for scroll animations
- Use Next.js Image component for optimized logo loading
- Make all CTAs track events for analytics (prepare for future implementation)
- Ensure WCAG AA accessibility compliance
- Test on mobile devices first
